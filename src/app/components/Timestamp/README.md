);
```

## Accessibility notes
The usage of the semantic `time` element within this component can result in strange behaviours when using assistive technology such as Voiceover for iOS. Specifically, it results in a "text splitting" behaviour, where any text in the prefix is read out, but the value inside the semantic `time` element require an additional swipe before being read out.

However, as we heavily encourage the use of this semantic element, and want to ensure it's usage is in line with [the W3C examples](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/textlevel-semantics.html#the-time-element), we feel this compromise is necessary.
