# Lighthouse test runner

This script accepts Lighthouse configs which are set in `/lighthouse.js`. Use the config file to set:

- The URLs Lighthouse should be run against
- The minimum thresholds required to pass each Lighthouse category (accessibility, best-practices, seo, progressive web apps, performance)
- Any other chrome flags desired; currently set to run headless Lighthouse

For each URL, the script will output Lighthouse scores for each category. A future version of this script can be made to fail a Travis CI build if minimum thresholds are not met (see logResults' checkFailures function for more detail.)
