## Installation

We recommend using the latest version of Node, currently version 10.

```
git clone
npm install
```

To run this application locally, run this
```
npm start
```
It will open the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## FYI
We're using Razzle - it abstracts away two webpack configs, one for the server and the other for the client.
